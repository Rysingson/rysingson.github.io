<b><p style="font-family: Arial">		Sometimes I sit and think. Sometimes I just sit. I grab another Wiston from the pack 
and light it. It always puzzled me how something so bad can be so awesome. Cigarette smoking
is the best drug. You can do it all the time. Everywhere. Sure, people look at you weird. People 
look at you weird regardless I think. They're always looking. So I sit back and smoke my cigarettes
like a king looking over his kingdom. Except I don't have a kingdom. I have 4 walls covered in dirty 
brown film. But those few minutes I have with the cigarette feels like a lifetime. It might be six.
Maybe ten. I keep chugging along and before I know it I'm at the bottom. The taste quickly turns into
the most disgusting gak that I've ever put into my mouth. What the fuck am I doing. I use the end of 
the cigarette to light up another one. They call that chain smoking. It sounds a lot cooler that way.
You know, if you put phrases to stuff, it's like music genres. It makes it all sound a lot cooler. But
none of that shit is cool. It's all just words. I used to think driving in the car with the windows down
was really cool. Then I did it a bunch and it wasn't cool anymore. I don't know if anything is cool anymore.
But that's MY problem. Sometimes when I sit here, I'm looking at a computer. Most of the time, actually.
Once in a while it stops feeling like I'm looking at anything. Sometimes I wonder if it's making me blind.
One time, my friend was visiting, she was talking and I was looking back and forth at the damn thing.
Streaks in my eyes. The room was spinning. But I just keep looking. I think I don't blink as much as other people.
Always got my shit wide open. I wanna see things. Would I rather be deaf or blind? I think I'd rather die than
answer the question. How unfair to the deaf and blind of you to assume I'd wanna be one or the other.</p></b>

<b><p style="font-family: Arial">	So now I watch a lot of film to pass the time. Except I don't. I think I'm less of a film critic and 
more-so I'm infatuated with the idea of movies. A bunch of pictures tell a big story. That sounds so awesome.
And it really is. I'm not even joking. Some people, they put the music to the film. They put the words and the
imagery and they make it all really special. Those people have a big brain. Like the kind a genius in a cartoon has.
The kind of brain you lean over and it makes you fall. That's what those people have to deal with, I think. I wouldn't
know. Some people are really shitty at making movies, like me. At least, I haven't made a lot of movies, anyway.
Is it fair to say you're good at something you don't do? I don't see why not. They're just words. Everyone has a lot
of bullshit words about a lot of bullshit stuff. Bullshit it up. Or be geniune. Be honest. Be kind. Be who you want to 
be! But what if you want to be a bullshitter? That's just stupid. I'm being stupid.</p></b>


	<b><p style="font-family: Arial">I hate to bring politics into this. That's what I think people want to hear. That guy on the subway, I saw
that other guy choked him out. I watch these things like a child. Everyone else wants to make it about something
complicated, but it really is very simple. A person kills another person. Remember when you were a kid? Adults used to tell you that violence was wrong.
But then you'd watch some kid get his shit kicked in. I threw punches into the eyes of other boys when I was young. I watched
young men get their ribs destroyed by guys bigger than them. That non-violence stuff is a load of shit. Some people, they want
to be a bullshitter. But not me. That chokehold was caught on video. The modern day. Now I don't just have to hear
about this shit. I have to watch it happen right before my eyes. I wasn't there. I'll never be there. But I saw what 
happened. A man died at the hands of another man. Think what you want but I can't call that just. To shit your pants on the subway?
Ya know, there are some people. They have to die. But you can't rob people of life. And you can't rob people of death. That's
how it works. If you wanna play hero than you need to step the fuck up. I don't sit around and pretend that I do much of anything.
I smoke my cigarettes in my dirty shithole and I watch, and I think, and I don't think. But if you want to be the person
who's going to change the fabric, especially through robbing life from another human being, than I'd expect you to have 
a pretty good fucking reason.</p></b>


	<b><p style="font-family: Arial">So how do you feel about homeless people? Maybe that's what it was all about. I started to notice an uptick in regular hatred.
It seems after some period it became okay to fucking hate people. So much that you want to hurt them. I'm not worried about it. I'm
not scared. I'm upset. I'm frustrated. Maybe this human being thing really is just a big fucking joke. Billionaires want to launch
rockets into space to figure out how to run away from this shit. There is no running away. So what do you do about people who are 
fucked up? Kill them, I guess? That's what that guy thinks. Maybe it's supremacy. Maybe he was just really pissed off. Who knows.
As of right now he was charged with manslaughter. You can't manslaughter someone by holding them down and choking them to death. That doesn't make any sense.
None of this makes any sense. I watched so many people choke to death. And for what? Apparently so I can watch other people choke to death.
I smoke and smoke and smoke. Hopefully I choke to death. I'm noticing a running theme here. And I don't like it.
But I don't like anything anymore.
